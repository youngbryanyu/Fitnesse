### Backend
1. Run `git clone https://github.com/youngbryanyu/Fitnesse.git` in your desired parent directory to clone the repository.
2. Run `cd Fitnesse/backend && npm install -g pnpm && pnpm install` to install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) as the package manager globally and install necessary dependencies in the backend server directory. You may need to run the command with `sudo` to have the permissions to install pnpm globally.
